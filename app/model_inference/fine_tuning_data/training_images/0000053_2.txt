A playful enamel badge featuring No-Face at the center, surrounded by spirits and characters from “Spirited Away.” The badge uses saturated purple, yellow, orange, and navy to create a vibrant yet balanced palette. The tone is fantastical, energetic, and distinctly Ghibli, with layered iconography and bold type. With white background.
