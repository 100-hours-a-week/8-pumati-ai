A round enamel badge showing a boy and girl riding a bicycle, with subtle outlines and pastel pink, cream, and orange tones. The badge reads “WHISPER OF THE HEART” and “1995” in elegant script. The style is nostalgic, romantic, and gently animated, with a sunset gradient feel. With white background.
